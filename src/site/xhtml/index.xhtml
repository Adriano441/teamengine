    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
    The Test, Evaluation, And Measurement (TEAM) Engine is a test harness that executes 
    test suites written using the OGC CTL test grammar or the <a href="http://testng.org/" 
    target="_blank">TestNG framework</a>. It is typically used to verify specification 
    compliance and is the official test harness of the <a href="http://cite.opengeospatial.org/" 
    target="_blank">OGC Compliance Testing Program</a> (CITE), where it is used to certify 
    implementations of OGC and ISO geomatics standards.
    </p>
    <p>
    TEAM Engine is a Java application that provides command-line and web interfaces to 
    execute test suites. A REST API is also available to run TestNG-based suites. A Java 
    runtime environment is necessary (JDK 6 or later), and <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/" 
    target="_blank">Apache Tomcat 7</a> is required to host the web application.
    </p>
    <p>
    When a CTL test suite is executed, the source scripts are transformed into a collection 
    of XSLT (v2.0) templates, one for each test. A form may be presented to the user to collect 
    test input parameters. The starting test is then invoked and the suite is executed using 
    the Saxon processor. Test outputs are written to log files as the test run proceeds.
    </p>
    <p>
    A light-weight plugin mechanism is provided by the <em>teamengine-api</em> module; it 
    enables support for alternative test controllers that can be invoked using a REST-like 
    API. The UML diagram shown below summarizes the essential design. A test controller 
    must implement the <code>TestSuiteController</code> and <code>TestRunExecutor</code> 
    interfaces.

    Executable test suites are automatically discovered using the Java <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html" 
    target="_blank">ServiceLoader facility</a>. A service provider is identified by placing 
    the appropriate configuration file in the resource directory META-INF/services.
