= Developing Tests for Application Profiles

== Introduction

This document offers guidance about how to develop and execute a test suite that verifies 
an implementation of some OGC application profile (<<definitions-profiles>>) that is based on one or more existing standards.
It is primarily intended for developers and other technical professionals who seek to test 
implementations that claim conformance to an OGC profile. For more general information about how to 
develop OGC conformance tests, see the http://opengeospatial.github.io/teamengine/[TEAM Engine documentation site].

A profile always has one or more dependencies that must be
heeded when developing an implementation or a conformance test suite. As indicated in <<wms-profiles>>,
a test suite for any WMS profile will include tests covering one or more conformance classes in 
the https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-wms13[OGC WMS conformance test suite]. The DGIWG profile 
requires conformance at the "Queryable WMS" level; the associated test suite also includes 
tests that cover the specific requirements of that profile.

A test suite for a profile generally selects one or more conformance classes (or levels) (<<definitions-conformance-classes>>)
from the relevant set of base specifications; these tests then implicitly become part of the 
dependent test suite. The base tests are invoked in the course of running the profile-specific 
tests. There are two methods how to include the dependent test suites:

1. Including the source code directly. The manner in which this is done depends on how a test suite is implemented (<<developing-profile-testng>> or <<developing-profile-ctl>>).
1. Invoking the dependent test suite remote via the REST API as described in <<developing-profile-restapi>>

A test suite that covers the requirements of an application profile is accessed and executed
just like any other test suite. It appears in the listing of available suites, and it can 
be selected and run in the same manner. See the following figure: <<dgiwg-profile>>.

[[developing-profile-testng]]
== TestNG

Most of the OGC conformance test suites developed in recent years are based on the 
http://testng.org/[TestNG framework]. The framework provides a simple declarative 
mechanism for incorporating tests from other suites in a test suite definition, which 
is an XML document that conforms to this http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd.php[document type definition].

[NOTE]
==========
While an XML file (conventionally named testng.xml) is often used to define a test suite, 
it is also possible to assemble the runtime definition programmatically using the TestNG 
API. The http://testng.org/javadocs/org/testng/xml/XmlSuite.html[XmlSuite] class is the 
entry point for doing this (it is correlated with the top-level <suite> tag).
==========

The root <suite> element contains one or more child <test> elements that correspond 
to conformance classes. These conformance classes may be drawn from other test suites.
For example, the WFS 2.0 test suite uses two conformance classes from the GML 3.2 
test suite. The following listing shows how this dependency is declared. Precondition is
that the base test suites are available in class path. If Maven is used the dependencies
of the base test suites must be included in the pom.xml

----
<suite name="wfs20-1.25" verbose="0" configfailurepolicy="continue">
  <parameter name="wfs"  value=""/>
  <parameter name="fid"  value=""/>

  <test name="All GML application schemas">
    <classes>
      <class name="org.opengis.cite.iso19136.general.XMLSchemaTests" />
      <class name="org.opengis.cite.iso19136.general.GeneralSchemaTests" />
      <class name="org.opengis.cite.iso19136.general.ModelAndSyntaxTests" />
      <class name="org.opengis.cite.iso19136.general.ComplexPropertyTests" />
    </classes>
  </test>
  <test name="GML application schemas defining features and feature collections">
    <classes>

    </classes>
  </test>
  <test name="Simple WFS">
    <packages>
      <package name="org.opengis.cite.iso19142.simple" />
    </packages>
  </test>
  <!-- remaining WFS tests -->
</suite>
----

The <test> sets are run in document order by default, which is usually the preferred behavior.
If any tests fail in a base conformance class, this can cause profile-specific tests to be 
skipped since there is already evidence of non-conformance.

=== How to

1. Create a new maven project
1. Include the dependencies of the base test suites
1. Create a testng.xml file including all tests form the base test suites
1. Implement the additional tests for the profile
1. Add the additional tests to the existing testng.xml

[[developing-profile-ctl]]
== CTL

The OGC Compliance Test Language (http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=33085[CTL]) 
specifies an XML grammar for defining a test suite. Some older OGC test suites were implemented 
using CTL scripts. In recent years test suites have been developed using the TestNG framework, 
and this is the recommended approach for new test suites. But some current profiles are based 
on older OGC standards for which only CTL-based test suites exist.

Tests may be organized into separate packages denoted by the ctl:package element; the main 
package must contain a ctl:suite element that identifies the starting test. The ctl:profile 
element may be used to formally define a test group that corresponds to a conformance class.
A profile must refer to its base test group (usually the main test suite), and it must also 
identify the starting test. The sample listing below displays a profile definition for the 
GET method binding in the https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-wmts10[WMTS test suite].

.Profile for the GET method binding in WMTS 1.0
[source,xml]
----
<profile xmlns="http://www.occamlab.com/ctl" name="wmts:server.profile.kvp.get">
  <title>WMTS 1.0 Server Compliance Test Profile for KVP GET binding</title>
  <description>Verifies that a WMTS 1.0 server implementation complies with conformance classes for KVP GET binding.</description>
  <defaultResult>Pass</defaultResult>
  <base>wmts:server.suite.base</base>
  <starting-test>wmts:server.profile.kvp.get.main</starting-test>
</profile>
----

The <base> element refers to the suite or profile (by name) that this profile depends on.
This establishes an implicit ordering, such that the root suite is run first and test 
execution follows the dependency graph.

It is required to include the required resources of the base test suites in the profile
test suite.

=== How To

1. Create a new maven project
1. Create a new CTL script as base entry point for the test suite
1. Include the required resources of the base test suites
1. Implement the additional tests for the profile

[[developing-profile-restapi]]
== Invoking test suites using a REST API

A RESTful API was introduced in order to provide a common mechanism for invoking a test 
suite regardless of its implementation. In effect, a test suite becomes a kind of 
"microservice".

Please see chapter *User's Guide* for a documentation of the interface and a full manual how to use the REST API.

As a concrete example, consider the https://portal.dgiwg.org/files/?artifact_id=11514&format=pdf[DGIWG WMS profile]
which is based on the OGC WMS 1.3 standard (also published as ISO 19128:2005). The profile requires 
implementation of the *Queryable WMS* conformance class as defined in the base standard. To verify 
this, the OGC test suite can be invoked using the REST API by submitting a GET request with 
the following query parameters (the target URI has been abbreviated to emphasize the query 
component):

    /rest/suites/wms/1.19/run?capabilities-url={wms-capabilities-url}&queryable=queryable

The format of the response depends on the requested output format and in case of XML of the
implementation of the requested test suite. The response must be parsed and the results integrated
in the report of the profile test suite.

=== How To

1. Create a new maven project
1. Implement a test invoking the REST API with the service under test
 a. Parse the response
 b. Integrate the results in the results of the new tests
1. Implement the additional tests for the profile
