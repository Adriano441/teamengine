= Profile Testing Guide

== Introduction

This document offers guidance about how to develop and execute a test suite that verifies 
an implementation of some OGC application profile that is based on one or more existing standards. 
It is primarily intended for developers and other technical professionals who seek to test 
implementations that claim conformance to an OGC profile. For more general information about how to 
develop OGC conformance tests, see the http://opengeospatial.github.io/teamengine/[TEAM Engine documentation site].

In http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=26011[ISO 19106], 
a profile is defined as a 

[quote, ISO 19106:2004 cl. 4.5]
__________
set of one or more base standards or subsets of base standards, and, where applicable, 
the identification of chosen clauses, classes, options and parameters of those base
standards, that are necessary for accomplishing a particular function.
__________

In practice, a profile imposes additional constraints on an implementation such as mandating 
support for an optional capability. Or it may define extensions where permitted by the base 
standards. However, a profile can *never* contradict any base standard, such that conformance 
to a profile implies conformance to _all_ of the base standards from which it is derived.

Various user communities have developed profiles based on OGC or ISO standards. For example:

* https://www.dgiwg.org/dgiwg/[DGIWG] - Web Feature Service Profile (DGIWG 122)
* DGIWG - Web Map Service Profile (DGIWG 112)
* NSG OGC Web Map Service 1.3 Interoperability Standard (Ed.)

The DGIWG WMS profile is based on the OGC WMS 1.3 specification, and the NSG WMS profile is in 
turn based on the DGIWG profile. A profile always has one or more dependencies that must be 
heeded when developing an implementation or a conformance test suite. As indicated in <<wms-profiles>>, 
a test suite for any WMS profile will include tests covering one or more conformance classes in 
the https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-wms13[OGC WMS conformance test suite]. The DGIWG profile 
requires conformance at the "Queryable WMS" level; the associated test suite also includes 
tests that cover the specific requirements of that profile.

A conformance class is essentially a container for a coherent set of requirements that 
address some functional capability or area of concern. A conformance level is a kind of 
conformance class in the which the requirements of a higher level contain all the requirements 
of the lower levels (see <<conformance-classes>>).

[[conformance-classes]]
.Conformance classes 
image::images/conformance-classes.png[Conformance classes,align=center]

A test suite for a profile generally selects one or more conformance classes (or levels) 
from the relevant set of base specifications; these tests then implicitly become part of the 
dependent test suite. The base tests are invoked in the course of running the profile-specific 
tests. However, the manner in which this is done depends on how a test suite is implemented.

A test suite that covers the requirements of an application profile is accessed and executed 
just like any other test suite. It appears in the listing of available suites, and it can 
be selected and run in the same manner. See the following figure: <<dgiwg-profile>>.

== TestNG

Most of the OGC conformance test suites developed in recent years are based on the 
http://testng.org/[TestNG framework]. The framework provides a simple declarative 
mechanism for incorporating tests from other suites in a test suite definition, which 
is an XML document that conforms to this http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd.php[document type definition].

[NOTE]
==========
While an XML file (conventionally named testng.xml) is often used to define a test suite, 
it is also possible to assemble the runtime definition programmatically using the TestNG 
API. The http://testng.org/javadocs/org/testng/xml/XmlSuite.html[XmlSuite] class is the 
entry point for doing this (it is correlated with the top-level <suite> tag).
==========

The root <suite> element contains one or more child <test> elements that correspond 
to conformance classes. These conformance classes may be drawn from other test suites.
For example, the WFS 2.0 test suite uses two conformance classes from the GML 3.2 
test suite. The following listing shows how this dependency is declared.

.Importing conformance classes from other test suites
[source,xml]
----
<suite name="wfs20-1.25" verbose="0" configfailurepolicy="continue">
  <parameter name="wfs"  value=""/>
  <parameter name="fid"  value=""/>

  <test name="All GML application schemas">
    <classes>
      <class name="org.opengis.cite.iso19136.general.XMLSchemaTests" />
      <class name="org.opengis.cite.iso19136.general.GeneralSchemaTests" />
      <class name="org.opengis.cite.iso19136.general.ModelAndSyntaxTests" />
      <class name="org.opengis.cite.iso19136.general.ComplexPropertyTests" />
    </classes>
  </test>
  <test name="GML application schemas defining features and feature collections">
    <classes>
      <class name="org.opengis.cite.iso19136.components.FeatureComponentTests" />
    </classes>
  </test>
  <test name="Simple WFS">
    <packages>
      <package name="org.opengis.cite.iso19142.simple" />
    </packages>
  </test>
  <!-- remaining WFS tests -->
</suite>
----

The <test> sets are run in document order by default, which is usually the preferred behavior.
If any tests fail in a base conformance class, this can cause profile-specific tests to be 
skipped since there is already evidence of non-conformance.

== CTL

The OGC Compliance Test Language (http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=33085[CTL]) 
specifies an XML grammar for defining a test suite. Some older OGC test suites were implemented 
using CTL scripts. In recent years test suites have been developed using the TestNG framework, 
and this is the recommended approach for new test suites. But some current profiles are based 
on older OGC standards for which only CTL-based test suites exist.

Tests may be organized into separate packages denoted by the ctl:package element; the main 
package must contain a ctl:suite element that identifies the starting test. The ctl:profile 
element may be used to formally define a test group that corresponds to a conformance class.
A profile must refer to its base test group (usually the main test suite), and it must also 
identify the starting test. The sample listing below displays a profile definition for the 
GET method binding in the https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-wmts10[WMTS test suite].

.Profile for the GET method binding in WMTS 1.0
[source,xml]
----
<profile xmlns="http://www.occamlab.com/ctl" name="wmts:server.profile.kvp.get">
  <title>WMTS 1.0 Server Compliance Test Profile for KVP GET binding</title>
  <description>Verifies that a WMTS 1.0 server implementation complies with conformance classes for KVP GET binding.</description>
  <defaultResult>Pass</defaultResult>
  <base>wmts:server.suite.base</base>
  <starting-test>wmts:server.profile.kvp.get.main</starting-test>
</profile>
----

The <base> element refers to the suite or profile (by name) that this profile depends on.
This establishes an implicit ordering, such that the root suite is run first and test 
execution follows the dependency graph.


== Invoking test suites using a REST API

A RESTful API was introduced in order to provide a common mechanism for invoking a test 
suite regardless of its implementation. In effect, a test suite becomes a kind of 
"microservice" that can be accessed as indicated in the table below.

.Test execution endpoints
[cols="2,2,1,1"]
|==========
|Path |Resource |Method(s) |Output format

|/rest/suites |List of available test suites |GET |XHTML
|/rest/suites/{ets-code}/{ets-version} |Test suite summary |GET |XHTML
|/rest/suites/{ets-code}/{ets-version}/run |Test run controller |GET, POST |XML, RDF/XML
|==========

The URI parameters are delimited by curly brackets; these are explained below.

ets-code:: The ETS code (example: "wfs20")
ets-version:: The ETS version (example: "1.25")

The list of available test suites is presented as a brief HTML document (XHTML syntax) that contains 
links to the deployed test suites. While the document can be displayed in a web browser for human 
viewers, it can also be consumed and parsed by other software applications in order to facilitate 
test execution. For example, a service description in a registry could be automatically annotated 
with information about its conformance status by running a test suite and inspecting the results.

.List of deployed test suites (XHTML syntax)
[source,xml]
----
<ul>
  <li><a href="suites/wfs20/1.25/" id="wfs20-1.25" type="text/html">WFS 2.0 (ISO 19142:2010) Conformance Test Suite</a></li>       
  <li><a href="suites/gml32/1.24/" id="gml32-1.24" type="text/html">GML (ISO 19136:2007) Conformance Test Suite, Version 3.2.1</a></li>
  <!-- other available test suites -->
</ul>
----

When the link for a particular test suite is dereferenced a summary document is obtained. This 
document briefly describes the test suite and contains a table of test run arguments. Each 
input argument is a separate entry in the body of an HTML table as shown in the listing below.

.Test run arguments for the WFS 2.0 test suite (raw HTML)
[source,xml]
----
<tbody>
  <tr id="wfs">
    <td>wfs</td>
    <td>URI</td>
    <td>M</td>
    <td>A URI that refers to a representation of the service capabilities document. 
    This document does not need to be obtained from the service under test (SUT),
    but it must describe the SUT. Ampersand ('&amp;') characters appearing within 
    a query parameter value must be percent-encoded as %26.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="fid">
    <td>fid</td>
    <td>NCName</td>
    <td>O</td>
    <td>An identifier that matches the @gml:id attribute value of an available feature 
    instance (may be omitted for "Basic WFS" implementations).</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
----

[[test-run-args]]
.Description of test run arguments presented in a web browser 
image::images/test-run-args.png[Test run arguments in browser,align=center]

A test run is initiated by submitting a request to the test run controller. The summary 
description lists the test run arguments (mandatory, conditional, optional) that are 
recognized by the controller. A test suite can be invoked using a simple GET request in most cases. 
For example, to test a WFS 2.0 implementation the target URI is constructed as follows (replace 
localhost:8080 with the actual host name and port number of an available teamengine installation):

    http://localhost:8080/teamengine/rest/suites/wfs20/1.25/run?wfs={wfs-capabilities-url}

where `{wfs-capabilities-url}` is the URL to retrieve the capabilities document for the 
implementation under test (IUT). Note that this need not be obtained directly from the IUT--it could be fetched from elsewhere (e.g. a service registry), as long as it describes the 
same service.

With TEAM Engine 4.9 or later it is also possible to invoke a CTL test suite in this manner.
However, a controller must be available in order to do this. The https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-wms13[WMS 1.3] 
test suite contains a https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-wms13/blob/master/src/main/java/org/opengis/cite/wms13/CtlController.java[CtlController class] 
that serves as an example of how to enable this capability in other CTL test suites.

As a concrete example, consider the https://portal.dgiwg.org/files/?artifact_id=11514&format=pdf[DGIWG WMS profile]
which is based on the OGC WMS 1.3 standard (also published as ISO 19128:2005). The profile requires 
implementation of the *Queryable WMS* conformance class as defined in the base standard. To verify 
this, the OGC test suite can be invoked using the REST API by submitting a GET request with 
the following query parameters (the target URI has been abbreviated to emphasize the query 
component):

    /rest/suites/wms/1.19/run?capabilities-url={wms-capabilities-url}&queryable=queryable

A successful response contains an XML entity that represents the test results. The root 
element contains a <log> child element for each test that was run. The first log entry
indicates the overall verdict; the value of the endtest/@result attribute is an integer 
code that signifies a test verdict (see table below).

.CTL test verdicts
[width="45%",frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|======================
|Code |Result
|1    |Passed
|2    |Not Tested
|3    |Skipped
|4    |Warning
|5    |Inherited Failure 
|6    |Failed
|======================

If a constituent test failed, the overall verdict is set as *Inherited Failure* (5).
In general, a failed subtest will "taint" all of its ancestor tests in this manner.


== Using the W3C EARL vocabulary

The default format of the test results is framework-specific: for TestNG, this is an XML 
representation having <testng-results> as the document element. The results of running a 
CTL test suite also produce XML output, with <execution> as the document element. Support 
for the W3C Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) 1.0 Schema has been introduced. The 
specification (currently a late stage working draft) defines an RDF vocabulary for 
describing test results:

* http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/[Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) 1.0 Schema]
* http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Guide/[Developer Guide for EARL 1.0]
* https://www.w3.org/TR/HTTP-in-RDF10/[HTTP Vocabulary in RDF 1.0]
* https://www.w3.org/TR/Content-in-RDF10/[Representing Content in RDF 1.0]

The following listing shows how conformance classes are described using the EARL vocabulary.
An `earl:TestRequirement` instance represents a conformance class; it has one or more 
constituent tests (`earl:TestCase`). Furthermore, a dependency may be expressed using 
the _dct:requires_ property. In this example, *Conformance level 2* is based on 
*Conformance level 1* and thus establishes a higher level of conformance.

The EARL vocabulary does not define any terms that pertain to a test run by itself. A custom 
vocabulary was introduced for this purpose. A `cite:TestRun` resource provides basic summary 
information about a test run, including the input arguments and an overall tally of test 
verdicts. Standard http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/[Dublin Core metadata terms] 
are employed where appropriate. For example, the dct:extent property reports the temporal 
extent of the test run; that is, its total duration represented using the XML Schema
https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration[duration datatype].
