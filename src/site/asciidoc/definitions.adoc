=== Conformance Classes

A conformance class is essentially a container for a coherent set of requirements that
address some functional capability or area of concern. A conformance level is a kind of
conformance class in the which the requirements of a higher level contain all the requirements
of the lower levels (see <<conformance-classes>>).

[[definitions-profiles]]
=== OGC application profile (Profile)

In http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=26011[ISO 19106],
a profile is defined as a

[quote, ISO 19106:2004 cl. 4.5]
__________
set of one or more base standards or subsets of base standards, and, where applicable,
the identification of chosen clauses, classes, options and parameters of those base
standards, that are necessary for accomplishing a particular function.
__________

In practice, a profile imposes additional constraints on an implementation such as mandating
support for an optional capability. Or it may define extensions where permitted by the base
standards. However, a profile can *never* contradict any base standard, such that conformance
to a profile implies conformance to _all_ of the base standards from which it is derived.

Various user communities have developed profiles based on OGC or ISO standards. For example:

* https://www.dgiwg.org/dgiwg/[DGIWG] - Web Feature Service Profile (DGIWG 122)
* https://www.dgiwg.org/dgiwg/[DGIWG] - Web Map Service Profile (DGIWG 112)
* NSG OGC Web Map Service 1.3 Interoperability Standard (Ed.)

The DGIWG WMS profile is based on the OGC WMS 1.3 specification, and the NSG WMS profile is in
turn based on the DGIWG profile (<<wms-profiles>>).
