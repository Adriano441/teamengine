The Test, Evaluation, And Measurement (TEAM) Engine is a testing facility that 
executes test suites developed using the [TestNG framework](http://testng.org/) or 
the OGC Compliance Test Language (CTL). It is typically used to verify specification 
compliance and is the official test harness of the [OGC Compliance Testing Program](http://cite.opengeospatial.org/) 
(CITE).

The OGC [maintains an installation](http://cite.opengeospatial.org/teamengine/) 
that is used to certify implementations of various OGC and ISO standards, such as:

- Web Feature Service (WFS)
- Catalogue Service (CSW)
- Web Map Service (WMS)
- GML 3.2.1 application schema
- GML 3.2.1 instance document (including a community profile defined in a 
supplementary Schematron schema)
- OGC KML
- WMS 1.3 client application
