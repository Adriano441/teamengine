TEAM ENGINE
=============

TEAM Engine (Test, Evaluation, And Measurement Engine) is a Java-based test 
harness for testing web services and other resources. It executes test scripts 
written in the OGC Compliance Test Language (CTL), TestNG and other languages. 
It is lightweight and easy to run as a command line or web application. It can 
be used to test any type of service or encoding. It is also the official tool 
used by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) for compliance testing.
