# Running TEAM Engine on dynamic infrastructure platforms

This module generates images for a variety of dynamic infrastructure platforms, such as:

* VirtualBox
* Amazon EC2
* Docker

The TEAM Engine [virtualization guide](http://opengeospatial.github.io/teamengine/virt-guide.html)
describes how to use [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) to create machine and container images.
It is also possible to use a Dockerfile to build an image. For more informations about TEAM Engine and Docker please see [teamengine-docker](https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine-docker).
